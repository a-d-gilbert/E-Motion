# E-Motion
This is a project I did for ENGL 350W that takes pictures and analyzes emotions and then presents poetry based on the emotional state. 

THis project uses python 3 and I used pip for package installation so I do not gurantee functionality in other versions of python are used, or if other python package installation managers are used.

### Necessary non-standard python packages:
*python-opencv
*google-cloud-vision
